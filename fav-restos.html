If we want to use the same styling as our blog's front page we can include the css stylesheet called main.css which you can find in the assets/stylesheets folder. To include a css stylesheet you need to use the <link> tag and include it within the <head> tags of your HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Favorite Restaurants</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/stylesheets/main.css">
    </head>
    <body>
    	<p> Yes, I like all kinds of food </>
